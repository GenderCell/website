        <h2>How ICC Supports</h2>
        <p>The Internal Complaints Committee (ICC) is established under the Sexual Harassment of Women at Workplace (Prevention, Prohibition, and Redressal) Act, 2013, to address complaints of sexual harassment. Here's how the ICC supports individuals facing harassment:</p>
        <div className="whole">
          <div className="whole1">
            <h3>1. Receiving Complaints:</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Multiple Channels for Reporting: The ICC provides various ways to report harassment, including in-person meetings, phone calls, emails, and written complaints. This ensures that individuals can choose the most comfortable and accessible method for them.</li>
              <li>Confidential Handling: All complaints are handled with utmost confidentiality to protect the privacy of the complainant.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>2. Initial Response:</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Immediate Acknowledgment: Upon receiving a complaint, the ICC promptly acknowledges it and provides the complainant with information on the process and timelines.</li>
              <li>Support and Counseling: The ICC offers emotional support and counseling services to the complainant, helping them cope with the distress caused by the harassment.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>3. Investigation Process:</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Fair Inquiry: The ICC conducts a fair and impartial inquiry into the complaint, gathering evidence and interviewing witnesses. Both the complainant and the respondent (the person against whom the complaint is made) are given an opportunity to present their case.</li>
              <li>Interim Measures: During the investigation, the ICC may recommend interim measures to protect the complainant, such as changing the work environment or ensuring no contact between the complainant and the respondent.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>4. Awareness and Training:</h3>
            <ul>
              <li>Educational Programs: The ICC organizes awareness programs and training sessions to educate employees and students about sexual harassment, their rights, and the procedures for filing complaints.</li>
              <li>Policy Dissemination: The ICC ensures that the institutionâ€™s policies on sexual harassment are widely disseminated and understood by all members of the community.</li>
            </ul>
